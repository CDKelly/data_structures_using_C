**Note**: Not all programming examples and exercises were completed in every chapter. Some chapters (e.g. chapter 2) were more academic and less interactive. Other than that, I mainly chose examples/exercises that would provide an extra programming challenge when tweaked slightly and/or shed light on a valuable programming concept (that I thought was particularly interesting or was initially struggling with).
